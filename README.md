# Graphical-Vector-Equation-Plotter
A program using matplotlib to plot graphical vector equations (since I couldn't really find anything else that did it right.)
Hopefully it is usefull, if there are changes I can make to improve it then please tell me.

## To run
Run the `setup.py`file or install the modules yourself (`numpy`, `matplotlib` and `mpl_toolkits`)
Then *close IDLE* and open `main.py` and run it.

## To use
It's quite self explanitary, you have to enter the vectors in a ceratin way (based on A-Level Further Maths), see the help button in the GUI.


## Works with
Written in Python 3.10.2 on Arch Linux, should work on any version of Python3 on most computers I think, I've used Tkinter to try to make it compatible.
