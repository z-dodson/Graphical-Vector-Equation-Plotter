# Graphical-Vector-Equation-Plotter
A program using matplotlib to plot graphical vector equations (since I couldn't really find anything else that did it right)

## To run
Run the `setup.py`file or install the modules yourself (`numpy`, `matplotlib` and `mpl_toolkits`)
The *close IDLE* and open `main.py` and run it
## To use
It's quite self explanitary, you have to enter the vectors in a ceratin way (based on A-Level Further Maths), see the help button in the GUI

## Editing it
The code is written in a fairly lazy way so its proberbly quite hard to understand at first, but it should be fairly simple to add new things to it

## Works with
Written in Python 3.10.2 on Arch Linux, should work on any version of python3 on most computers I think, ive used Tkinter to try to make it compatible
